**Welcome to all !!**

This simple bot is just a little help to start creating one

**I recommend to all of you read the docs of Discord and the docs of Discord.py before you start**

Discord docs: https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro

Discord.py docs: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

To run this application you just will need to create a virtualenv and install the requirements with the command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

And you will need to insert your bot information, after that you run your application and test your bot.
